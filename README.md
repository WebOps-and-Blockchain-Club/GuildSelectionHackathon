## Q4: Design and develop a decentralized freelancing platform leveraging blockchain technology. 

Freelancing platforms are often plagued by high fees, limited payment options, and trust issues between freelancers and clients. These centralized platforms hold a lot of control over contracts, payments, and dispute resolution, leading to inefficiencies and unfair practices. 

The platform should provide the following key features:

1. Decentralized Escrow System: Implement a smart contract-based escrow system that holds payments until project milestones are verified and completed. This should reduce payment risks and disputes between freelancers and clients.

2. Reputation System: Build a decentralized, immutable reputation or rating system based on blockchain to ensure authentic reviews, enhancing trust between freelancers and clients.

3. Decentralized Identity: Provide a decentralized identity system (DID) for freelancers and clients to manage their profiles.

4. Payment Integration: Implement a seamless payment solution using cryptocurrencies, ensuring lower fees and global access.

The solution should focus on providing greater transparency, trust, and autonomy to both freelancers and clients, addressing the limitations of current centralized platforms.

3. Transparent and automatic payment distribution to all involved parties.
