> _Don't build alone_

## Q1. Make a simple Website that show cares the following features

1. Role based auth (Admin should have ability to change permission)
2. It should use Web Sockets in some feature.
3. The need to use display in memory data base like redis for caching along side the primary database. (Optional)
4. Use some extrenal Apis.

Its a open ended Problem use as many as you can of the above points. The creativity of the final submission matters a lot.

## Q2.

Develop a seamless, integrated platform designed to enhance productivity and collaboration for remote teams. This solution will include key features such as real-time messaging, task management, and collaborative editing of documents and spreadsheets. (Make something better than notion)
Tech Stack:
Any other frontend framework/library or HTML/CSS, Node.js, MongoDB or PostgreSQL, Socket.io
Bonus: `WebRTC` (Optional)

## Q3.

Make a Mobile App the uses the following features

1. Computer vision
   1. QR reading.
   2. Photo aliging(like in PDF parsers)
2. WebRTC (Optional)
3. Video Streaming for a database.
   use your creativity to make something the people with like to use.

## Q4: Design and develop a decentralized freelancing platform leveraging blockchain technology.

Freelancing platforms are often plagued by high fees, limited payment options, and trust issues between freelancers and clients. These centralized platforms hold a lot of control over contracts, payments, and dispute resolution, leading to inefficiencies and unfair practices.

The platform should provide the following key features:

1. Decentralized Escrow System: Implement a smart contract-based escrow system that holds payments until project milestones are verified and completed. This should reduce payment risks and disputes between freelancers and clients.
2. Reputation System: Build a decentralized, immutable reputation or rating system based on blockchain to ensure authentic reviews, enhancing trust between freelancers and clients.
3. Decentralized Identity: Provide a decentralized identity system (DID) for freelancers and clients to manage their profiles.
4. Payment Integration: Implement a seamless payment solution using cryptocurrencies, ensuring lower fees and global access.

The solution should focus on providing greater transparency, trust, and autonomy to both freelancers and clients, addressing the limitations of current centralized platforms.

## Q5 A Web3 platform where users can create group payments (for events, bills, etc.), and the smart contract automatically splits the amount between participants and handles the payment distribution.

The platform should provide the following key features:

1. Create payment groups and smart contracts automatically divide the amount.
2. Track who has paid and who hasn’t via blockchain.
3. Transparent and automatic payment distribution to all involved parties.

## Q6 (only for Freshies new to webdev)

### Title: Build a Note-Taking Webpage

Overview:
As part of the hackathon, your challenge is to create a simple yet functional note-taking webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus is on building a platform that allows users to create, save, and view notes using basic file operations. You'll need to demonstrate the ability to manipulate data through front-end interactions and present a user-friendly interface.

Core Requirements:

1.  Webpage Features :

- Users should be able to create new notes.
- Users should be able to view their saved notes.
- Implement functionality to save and retrieve notes using basic file operations (e.g., get and put).

2.  User Interface (UI) :

- Create a clean, intuitive design for the note-taking webpage.
- Use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions.

Bonus Points :

- Innovation : Think outside the box! Any creative features that enhance the note-taking experience will earn extra points.

# Instructions

- You have to solve ANY ONE Question amoung Q1 Q2 and Q3 for Web Dev and App Dev guild
- If you are a new to Web Dev try Q6 only for freshies(don't choose this if you have experience in webdev, you may loose lots of opportunities).
- For Blockchain you have to solve both Q4 and Q5
- For questions Q4 and Q5 full functioning websites should be made(including frontend and not just smart contracts)
- You can choose any blockchain network you want for Q4 and Q5 preferably EVM capatible networks.
- You can work on this from any where
- Deploy your webpage on platforms like Vercel and host the code on GitHub for public viewing and feedback.
- Don't worry if you can't complete the full ps. Your approach and ideas matters more.

# Deadline: `15th EOD`

# Bonus Points

- Innovation
- Deployment
- UI/UX
